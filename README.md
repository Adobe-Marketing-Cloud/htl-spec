[Sightly](http://docs.adobe.com/content/docs/en/aem/6-0/develop/sightly.html "Sightly") is the new HTML templating language introduced with [Adobe Experience Manager](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/web-experience-management.html) 6.0.

This is the [Sightly Specification](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/sightly-spec/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md) that defines the syntax and the behavior of the language.

A Java-based reference implementation is in the process of being [donated to the Apache Sling project](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-3959).

The [Technology Compatibility Kit](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/sightly-tck) can be run on implementations to check their compliance with the specification.
