[Sightly](http://docs.adobe.com/content/docs/en/aem/6-0/develop/sightly.html "Sightly") is the new HTML templating system introduced with [Adobe Experience Manager](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/web-experience-management.html) 6.0.

If you're looking for the language's specification, please check the [specification definition file](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/sightly-spec/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md).

The Java-based reference implementation is currently in the [process of being donated to the Apache Sling project](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-3959).

A TCK will soon be made available in this repository that can be run on multiple implementations to check their compliance with the specification.
