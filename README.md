HTML Template Language Specification
====
The [HTML Template Language](https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/htl.html "Introduction to the HTML Template Language") (HTL), formerly known as Sightly, has been introduced with [Adobe Experience Manager](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/web-experience-management.html) 6.0 and takes the place of JSP (JavaServer Pages) as the preferred and recommended server-side template system for HTML.

This is the [HTL Specification](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/htl-spec/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md) that defines the syntax and the behavior of the language.

A Java-based reference implementation has been [donated to the Apache Sling project](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-3959) and can be checked out from https://github.com/apache/sling/tree/trunk/bundles/scripting/sightly.

The [Technology Compatibility Kit](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/htl-tck) can be run on implementations to check their compliance with the specification.

An implementation of [version 1.2](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/htl-spec/blob/1.2/SPECIFICATION.md) of the language specification is available in AEM 6.2.
